Field Descriptions:

warehouseURL		The Warehouse URL for the WebSocket server hosted on the Connected Vehicle Warehouse.
					The Warehouse uses WebSockets (https://www.websocket.org/) to deliver data to this client. 

casURL				The CAS URL for the CAS server used by the Warehouse for user authentication (https://wiki.jasig.org/display/CAS/Home)
casUserName			The userName for CAS authentication.
casPassword			The password for CAS authentication.

requestDir			The directory watched by this application for queries or subscription requests to execute.  New files added or files changed
					in this directory are sent to the Warehouse.
responseDir			The directory where messages received from the Warehouse are written to (if writeToDisk is true)

logMessages			Set to true to log messages to the console.
writeToDisk			Set to true to write messages to disk.
binaryFiles			If false, messages are written as the selected hex, base64, full (json) format.  If true, the messages are converted to raw 
					bytes and written as out binary .uper files.
					
systemDepositName	The name of the system you want to deposit messages into.  Currently only "SDC 2.3" and "SDW 2.3" are supported.
encodeType			The encoding type of the messages to be placed in depositFileDir.  Valid types are "HEX", "Base64", and "UPER".  Messages that
					are placed in the depositFileDir must match the encodeType specified or an error will be generated.  To switch encodeType, stop
					the application, change the value for encodeType and restart the application.  For "HEX", and "Base64" types, the files placed in
					the depositFileDir may contain multiple messages (one message per line).  The "UPER" type requires a file per message.
depositFileDir		The directory watched for messages to be deposited.
depositDelay		A delay in milliseconds that is applied between sending each message in a multi-message file or between sending individual UPER files.
